<p>This year,Hogwarts has been nominated to host the coveted Triwizard Tournament. Harry has
been selected to represent Hogwarts at the tournament.Being the hosts,the stakes are high &
Harry doesn't want to disappoint anyone.</p>
<p>
Harry in the second task in his quest to win the Triwizard Cup needs to rescue his friends which
have been captured by the Merpeople.</p>
<p>
Viktor Krum rescued Hermione whereas Cedric Diggory rescued Cho Chang.Unfortunately,Fleur
Delacour was attacked by the grindylows & could not complete the task.Harry now needs to
rescue both Ron & Gabrielle Delacour from the wrath of the sea.</p>
<p>
The Merpeople would only allow Harry to rescue one of them.However,they would allow Harry
to rescue both of them only if he solves a puzzle.</p>
<p>The puzzle is as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Given a rectangular paper of length <b>L</b> and breadth <b>B</b>, we needs to cut a square piece out of it such 
that the square has side of maximum possible length. </li>
	<li>Atleast one side of this square needs to be touching an edge of the initial paper.</li>
	<li>After cutting, there will be a certain amount of paper left. We needs to carry out the same steps on this piece that remains after cutting.</li>
	<li>This process needs to be carried on until there is no paper left.</li>
	<li>At the end, we need to state the unique lengths of all square that were cut, and the number of squares that were cut of that length (frequency).</li>
	<li>These lengths and the corresponding freauencies needs to be printed in descending order of length.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Time is running low for Ron & Gabrielle, Harry needs to quickly solve the problem but he's not really good with puzzles. 
So he's asking you to solve the problem for him.</p>
<p>
Help Harry solve the puzzle & save both Ron & Gabrielle.

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases. </br>
The next <b>T</b> lines contains 2 space separated integers <b>L</b> and <b>B</b> denoting the initial length and breadth of the paper.</p>


<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case print <b>k</b> lines with two integers, side-length of square <b>(S<sub>i</sub>)</b> and number of squares with side-length  S<sub>i</sub>, i.e. <b>(C<sub>i</sub>)</b>,  in descending order of their side-lengths, where <b>k</b> is the no of squares with unique side-length</p>

<h3>Constraints</h3>
<p>Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>1</b> ≤ <b>T</b> ≤ <b>10<sup>4</sup></b></li>
<li><b>1</b> ≤ <b>L</b> ≤ <b>10<sup>18</sup></b></li>
<li><b>1</b> ≤ <b>B</b> ≤ <b>10<sup>18</sup></b></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>

6 5

<b>Output:</b>
5 1
1 6
</pre>

<ul>
	<li>Initially the paper is of dimension <b>6</b> x <b>5</b></li>
	<li>The largest square that can be made in this state is of dimension <b>5</b> x <b>5</b></li>
	<li>After cutting out the <b>5</b> x <b>5</b> square, we're left with paper of dimension <b>5</b> x <b>1</b></li>
	<li>Now the maximum size square we can make is <b>1</b> x <b>1</b></li>
	<li>After removing <b>1</b> x <b>1</b> we are left with <b>4</b> x <b>1</b> paper. Again the largest square that can be made is of <b>1</b> x <b>1</b></li>
	<li>We carry this process until we are left with no paper.</li>
	<li>So we made <b>1</b> square of length <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> squares of length <b>1</b></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Example case 2.</b></p>
<p>
<img src="https://image.ibb.co/jhuBsQ/Whats_App_Image_2017_08_27_at_3_43_54_PM.jpg" ></p>
<ul>
	<li>Initially the paper is of dimension <b>4</b> x <b>2</b></li>
	<li>The largest square that can be made is if dimension <b>2</b> x <b>2</b></li>
	<li>After removing the <b>2</b> x <b>2</b> square we are left with <b>2</b> x <b>2</b> paper</li>
	<li>Since this is itself a square, it becomes the current largest possible square so we cut it out.</li>
	<li>After above step we are left with no paper</li>
	<li>So we made <b>2</b> squares of length <b>2</b></li>
</ul>
