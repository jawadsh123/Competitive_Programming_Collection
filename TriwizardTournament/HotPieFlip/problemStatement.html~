<p>In an alternate Universe, Queen Cersei has won the battle for Westeros.
Even the white walkers have bent there skeletal knee.</p>

<p>To celebrate such an amazing victory, a Grand Feast has been planned at
King's Landing. The Queen has ordered the "Inn at the Crossroads" to make N
number of pies for the occasion. "Hot-Pie", the famous bread maker, now oversees the functioning of "Inn
at the Crossroads" and so the responsibility falls onto him.</p>

<p>Each Pie has two sides, the <b>top</b> side (with all the toppings) and the
<b>base</b>. The pies are cooked in a single row over a hot surface. In
haste, Hot-Pie has placed the pies randomly (i.e. Somewhere the Top is facing
up, somewhere the Base is facing up)</p>

<p>In order to be properly cooked, all the pies need to be with Top side
facing up. Unfortunately, Hot-Pie does not have a regular Pie flipper at
disposal. All the utensils are in use by other Chefs, except for an oversized
Pie Flipper that flips exactly <b>K</b> consecutive pies. That is, in that 
range of <b>K</b> pies, it changes every Top-side pie to a Back-side pie,
and vice versa; it does not change the left-to-right order of those pies.</p>

<p>You cannot flip fewer than <b>K</b> pies at a time with the flipper, even at the 
ends of the row (since there are raised borders on both sides of the cooking surface). For example, you can flip the first <b>K</b> pies, but not the first <b>K - 1</b> pies.</p>

<p>Since there is very little time left for the feast, all the pies need to be brought into Top-side up position as soon as possible. 
Hot-Pie, as you may know, is not really good with problem solving and hence has asked you for help.</p>

<p>Given the current state of the pies, calculate the minimum number of uses of the oversized pie flipper needed to leave all pies Top-side up, or state that there is no way to do it.</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, <b>T</b>. <b>T</b> test cases follow. Each consists of one line with a string <b>S</b> and an integer <b>K</b>. <b>S</b> represents the row of pies: each of its characters is either <b>+</b> (which represents a pie that is initially Top-side up) or <b>-</b> (which represents a pie that is initially Back-side up).</s>
<p> </p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case output an integer representing the minimum number of times you will need to use the 
oversized pancake flipper to get all the pies Top-side up or print <pre>IMPOSSIBLE</pre> if there is no way to do it.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Constraints</h3>
<p>Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>1</b> ≤ <b>T</b> ≤ <b>...</b></li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
