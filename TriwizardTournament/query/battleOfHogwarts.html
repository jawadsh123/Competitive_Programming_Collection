<p>
Professor Dumbledore has just been informed that Lord Voldemort has gathered a huge army of Wizards and Witches and is marching towards Hogwarts to attack from the North.
To prepare for the attack, Dumbledore ordered all the Wizards and Witches at Hogwarts to spread across the Northern border of the school.
</p>
<p>
The border can be imagined as a straight line of length <b>N</b> units. At each unit a wizard is stationed.
</p>
<p>
Voldemort has a special way of attack. He sends a few people from his army every hour to attack, and the war will last for <b>Q</b> hours.
On each hour he attacks a part of border between <b>L</b> and <b>R</b> units (both inclusive) with <b>C</b> wizards of class <b>W</b>.
</p>
<p>
Dumbledore knows about this attacking strategy.
He Knows that in order to protect Hogwarts from getting destroyed he needs to have atleast <b>C</b> wizard of class <b>W</b> stationed in the part of the border that is being attacked. (i.e. between <b>L</b> and <b>R</b>)
</p>
<p>
The border is huge and there is no time to change the positions of wizards. 
You are the war tactician at Hogwarts and you have been given an Array <b>A</b> with array element <b>A[i]</b> denoting the class of wizard stationed at ith position and you have been asked to find whether the part that is being attacked will stand or not in a '<b>YES</b>' or '<b>NO</b>' format.
</p>
<p> </p>



<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases. The description of <b>T</b> test cases follows.</p>
<p>First line of each test case contains two space seperated integers <b>N</b> and <b>Q</b> denoting length of the border, and time period of war (in hours) respectively.</p>
<p>Next line of each test case contains <b>N</b> space seperated integers that form an array <b>A</b>, where <b>A[i]</b> denotes the class of wizard at ith unit,</p>
<p>The next <b>Q</b> lines of each test case contains 4 space separated integers <b>L</b>, <b>R</b>, <b>W</b> and <b>C</b> denoting start of range, end of range, class of attacking wizards and count of attacking wizards repectively.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each Query <b>Q</b> output a single line of either '<b>YES</b>' or '<b>NO</b>', without quotes.</p>
<p>Print 'YES' - if the attacking wizards can be defeated</p>
<p>Print 'NO' - if the wizards cannot be defeated</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p><b><u>Query 1:</u></b></p>
<p>For the first query, L=0, R=1, W=1, C=1. Since there is 1 wizard of class "<b>1</b>" present in range (0-1), which is >= C, the answer is "YES"</p>

<p><b><u>Query 2:</u></b></p>
<p>L=1, R=4, W=2, C=2. Since there are 2 wizards of class "<b>2</b>" present in range (1-4), which is >= C, the answer is "YES"</p>

<p><b><u>Query 3:</u></b></p>
<p>L=1, R=4, W=2, C=3. Since there are only 2 wizards of class "<b>2</b> present in range (1-4), which is <= C, the answer is "NO"</p>
