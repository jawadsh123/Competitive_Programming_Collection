<p>The Dragon Queen (Danaerys) is about to land in King's Landing for meeting with the High Lords. Danaerys, flashy as usual, has come riding on a Dragon and she plans to land on the Dragon's Pit.</p>
<p>The Dragon's Pit is a giant rectangle made out of R*C square cells. (i.e. length=R, breadth=C)</p>
<p>Queen Cersei, having anticipated this, has filled the pit with Lannister Army. Each cell in the pit has a certain number of army men standing on it. So each cell has a number assigned to it that denotes the number of people standing on it.</p>
<p>Tyrion has reached by ship, and now witnesses the situation. He knows that only Dragon's pit is big enough to land a Dragon in King's Landing. So now he needs to clear a rectangle in the pit for the Queen to land. Luckily he has got some Wildfire at his disposal. To clear a particular rectangular section (sub-matrix) of the pit, <b>x</b> units of wildfire needs to be used.</p>
<p>For a particular sub-matrix, <b>x</b> = XOR sum of all the cells present in that region. Tyrion is trying to find a satisfactory sub matrix to clear. You will assist him in this task.</p>
<p>The problem will go as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Tyrion needs to run <b>Q</b> queries</li>
	<li>Each query will have four inputs - <b>(x1, y1)</b>, <b>(x2, y2)</b>, which are diagonally opposite points of a sub-matrix.</li>
	<li>Your task is to find the number of units of Wildfire required to clear the sub-matrix formed by above points. (i.e. to find the XOR Sum of all the cells present in that sub-matrix)</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>With your crazy math skills, and Tyrion's intellect, we hope to see the Queen land and make History.</p>
<p></p>


<h3>Input</h3>

<p>The first line gives three space separated integers <b>R</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>Q</b>, giving the number of rows, number of columns and the number of
Queries</p>
<p>The next <b>R</b> lines each contain, space separated <b>C</b> integers giving the elements of the rows
The next <b>Q</b> lines each contain space separated four integers giving the top left and bottom right coordinates of the sub matrices
(rows are numbered 0 to R­-1 and columns are numbered 0 to C­-1, and the top left corner of the matrix has coordinates 0, 0.</p>


<h3>Output</h3>
<p><b>Q</b> lines each giving XOR sum of all the elements in the corresponding Sub Matrix.</p>


<h3>Constraints</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>5</b> ≤ <b>R</b> ≤ 1000</li>
	<li><b>5</b> ≤ <b>C</b> ≤ 1000</li>
	<li><b>5</b> ≤ <b>Q</b> ≤ 1000000</li>
</ul>
<p>The elements of the matrix are integers in the range 0 to 100</p>


<h3>Subtasks</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>Subtask 1</b> (10 points): <b>1</b> ≤ <b>Q</b> ≤ 100</b></li>
	<li><b>Subtask 2</b> (90 points): Original Contraints</li>
</ul>
